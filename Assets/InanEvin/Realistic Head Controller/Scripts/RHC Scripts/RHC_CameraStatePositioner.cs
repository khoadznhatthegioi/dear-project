 * Class Description:
 *
 * This class is a state positioner. Meaning it is used to change the position & rotation of the head/camera, according to the player state. It takes event inputs from the class RHC_EventManager.
 * The event caster class RHC_EventManager has logic to fire off event that says "Player has changed it's Stance/Movement state to this: ". This class listens to that,
 * and accordingly fires off the necessary Coroutine to interpolate the head orientation. You can implement your own state machines & managers. You can still use this class
 * freely & easily as long as you subscribe the method EVO_StanceStateChanged to your own event.
 *
 * This class supports 5 orientations in default:
 * - Default : The position & rotation of the head while standing.
 * - Air: The position & rotation of the head when jumped.
 * - Air Down: The position & rotation of the head when landed. (instant)
 * - Crouch: The position & rotation of the head while crouching.
 * - Prone: The position & rotation of the head while proning.
 *
 * The coolest part is, it's really easy to implement new states according to your own player controller. Just look at the script, copy & paste variables & methods, refactor, and you would be good to go.
 * You can always ask to me about any issue/implementation from the contact informations, including live chat, that were mentioned above.
