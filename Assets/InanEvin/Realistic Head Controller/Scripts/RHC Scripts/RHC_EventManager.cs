 * Class Description:
 *
 * This class is used to manage player events. In player events, there are 4 events registered by default:
 * -movementStateChanged
 * -stanceStateChanged
 * -recoilShake
 * -genericShake
 * -customShake
 *
 * **********
 * MovementStateChanged & StanceStateChanged: These 2 events are written for player state machines. Advanced Head & Camera Movement uses interleaved logic to decide what kind of head behaviour should be applied, in the means of
 * positioning & rotationing the camera, and bobbing the camera, according to these 2 events. The logic is like this:
 * Player may be standing up straight. While standing, it may just idle(doesn't move), walk or run.
 * Player may be crouching. While crouching, it may just idle(doesn't move), walk while crouching, or run while crouching.
 * Player may be proning. While proning, it may just idle(doesn't move), walk while proning -by this we mean crawling slowly-, or run while proning -meaning crawling fast-.
 *
 * So as you can see, 2 main categories are implemented for player state machine logic. First MovementStates, which means if player's idling, walking or running. Second, StanceStates, which means if player's standing up,
 * crouching or proning.
 *
 * These two events would be fired with defined player states on the player controlling classes, and then the other scripts will do the rest! 
 * Listener(s): 
 * 1) RHC_BobController -> Listens to movementStateChanged & stanceStateChanged. 
 * 2) RHC_CameraStatePositioner -> Listens to stanceStateChanged.
 *
 *
 * When using your own custom player controller, just remember to fire call static methods PSVO_MovementStateChanged & PSVO_StanceStateChanged accordingly. The scripts will handle the rest! 
 * More detail about implementation is explained in the docs!
 * **********
 *
 * **********
 * recoilShake: This event would be fired off whenever you want to simulate hit shake(camera recoil) when the player is hit or simulate firing recoil. Just call PSVO_RecoilShake() static method from anywhere!
 * The variables on the RHC_CameraShake class gives the shake effect accordingly.
 * Listener(s):
 * 1) RHC_CameraShake -> Listens to recoilShake.
 * **********
 *
 * **********
 * genericShake: This event would be fired off whenever you want to simulate generic shakes on the camera, like explosions or earthquakes. Just call PSVO_CallGenericShake(Vector3 sourcePosition) static method from anywhere!
 * Listener(s):
 * 1) RHC_CameraShake -> Listens to genericShake & customShake & recoilShake.
 *
 * **********
 * customShake: This event would be fired off whenever you want to simulate generic shakes on the camera, like explosions or earthquakes, by using the input parameters. Just call PSVO_CallCustomShake(Vector3 posShakeAmount, Vector3 posShakeSpeed, Vector3 rotShakeAmount, Vector3 rotShakeSpeed, float * shakeTime) static method from anywhere!
 * Listener(s):
 * 1) RHC_CameraShake -> Listens to customShake & customShake & recoilShake.
